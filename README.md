# DraggableGridView
A grid style collection view written in SwiftUI that supports to change a position of any item on it by dragging.

## Requirements
SwiftUI
iOS 13.1 or higher

## How to Use
`DraggableGridView.swift` involves a test view named `PreviewBaseView` to make it testable on Preview.  
I am sure that it's enough for the test view to show how to use the grid view for now.  

## Install
I haven't made this project support any dependency manager because this is just for sharing my idea how to create this kind of collection view.  
If you, therefore, would like to use this view on your project, just simply copy `DraggableGridView.swift` and put it into your project. Or you may be able to make a PR for your preferred manager.
